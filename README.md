## Introduction and Main Objective

Information asymmetry-based arbitrage represents one of the most sophisticated strategies in quantitative trading. The fundamental objective is to **exploit information asymmetry** to take advantage of market makers who are too slow to cancel or modify their quotes on exchanges.

This strategy is based on the principle that information doesn't spread instantaneously across all markets, creating temporary profit opportunities for those who can access and process information faster than the competition. Our specific goal is to adversely fill market makers who exhibit latency in updating their quotes.

## Opportunity Identification

### Low Liquidity Markets

Some markets require time before converging to a fair value. These markets are characterized by:
- **Low liquidity**: Fewer participants and reduced trading volumes
- **Higher latency in price discovery**: Prices adjust more slowly
- **Wider bid-ask spreads**: Offer greater profit opportunities but also higher risks

Low liquidity creates temporary inefficiencies that can be exploited by those with superior or more timely information.

### Binary Contracts and Step Functions

Ideal targets for this strategy are:
- **Binary contracts**: Instruments with only two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, above/below)
- **Prices with step functions**: Price changes dramatically in response to specific information

These instruments are particularly sensitive to news and offer the best information arbitrage opportunities since their value can change instantly upon release of new information.

## Market Selection Criteria

### Target Markets

Focus on markets that require time to converge toward fair value, characterized by:
- **Low liquidity**: Limited market depth and participation
- **Delayed price discovery**: Gradual information incorporation
- **Wide spreads**: Opportunities for advantageous fills

### Contract Types

Primary targets are:
- **Binary contracts**: Yes/no outcomes with discrete price jumps
- **Step function pricing**: Prices that exhibit dramatic shifts upon information release
- **Event-based markets**: Contracts tied to specific, verifiable outcomes

Examples: Political prediction markets, coin listing announcements, regulatory decisions

## System Architecture

### Process Pipeline

The complete operational flow includes:
1. **Bet/opportunity identification** on a particular Exchange
2. **Identification of information sources** relevant to that event
3. **Continuous monitoring** of identified sources
4. **Automated analysis** through intelligent agents/parsers
5. **Trading decision** based on classification
6. **Immediate order execution** based on analysis

### Logger Importance

An efficient logging system is **fundamental** for:
- **Real-time debugging**: Quickly identify problems in data flow
- **Website change monitoring**: Sites can change format, compromising scrapers
- **Audit trail**: Maintain a history of system decisions
- **Performance monitoring**: Track latencies and response times
- **Error management**: Quick recovery from partial failures

The logger must be designed to handle high volumes of events without impacting main system performance.

## Data Acquisition Techniques

### Web Scraping

Scraping is essential for obtaining data from various sources like government sites (e.g., White House website). Main challenges include:
- **Dynamic HTML**: Requires browser automation
- **Rate limiting**: Need to manage requests to avoid blocks
- **Structural changes**: Websites frequently modify their structure

### Undocumented Endpoint Discovery

Many sites don't publish API documentation, but it's possible to:
1. Use browser **developer tools**
2. Intercept network calls
3. Identify hidden endpoints
4. Reverse-engineer APIs

The guiding principle is: **"If something is displayed, it can be retrieved"**.

### Browser Automation

For sites with dynamic content:
- Use tools like Selenium or Puppeteer
- Simulate user interactions
- Handle JavaScript rendering
- Manage popups and captchas
- Extract HTML content for parsing

## Asynchronous Programming for Continuous Monitoring

### Why Asynchronous Architecture

Traditional synchronous programming with infinite loops would block execution:
```python
while True:
    check_source()  # This blocks everything else
```

For arbitrage systems, we need **concurrent monitoring** of multiple sources without blocking. Asynchronous programming allows:
- Simultaneous monitoring of multiple information sources
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Efficient resource utilization
- Real-time responsiveness

### Implementation Approaches

Several approaches can achieve concurrent monitoring:

1. **AsyncIO (Recommended for I/O-bound tasks)**
   ```python
   async def monitor_source(url):
       while True:
           data = await fetch_data(url)
           process_data(data)
           await asyncio.sleep(interval)
   ```

2. **Threading (For I/O-bound operations with blocking libraries)**
   - Useful when dealing with libraries that don't support async
   - Good for web scraping with requests library

3. **Multiprocessing (For CPU-intensive parsing)**
   - Ideal for heavy data processing
   - True parallelism for CPU-bound tasks

### Concurrency Management

Key considerations for concurrent monitoring:
- **Event Loop Management**: Central coordination of all async tasks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming sources with requests
- **Error Isolation**: Failure in one monitor shouldn't affect others
- **Resource Pooling**: Manage connections and browser instances efficiently
- **Task Prioritization**: Critical sources get more frequent updates

Example architecture:
```python
async def main():
    tasks = [
        monitor_twitter(),
        monitor_gov_sites(),
        monitor_exchanges(),
        process_queue()
    ]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Information Acquisition Pipeline

### Source Identification

For each trading opportunity, systematically:
1. Identify the specific bet/contract on the exchange
2. Map relevant information sources for that event
3. Establish monitoring protocols for each source
4. Route captured information to analysis agents

### Twitter/X Monitoring

Optimized Twitter scraping approach:
1. **Account creation** for API access and reduced calls
2. **Cookie-based authentication** to bypass rate limits
3. **Rolling window tracking** of 10 most recent tweets
4. **Deep content extraction**: Click into tweets for full text
5. **New tweet detection** and forwarding to parsers

Twitter represents a critical source for:
- **Real-time information**: News often appears first on Twitter
- **Sentiment analysis**: Understanding market mood
- **Breaking news**: Unscheduled announcements

### Institutional Sites

Government and institutional websites are primary sources of market-moving information:
- Official press releases
- Economic data
- Policy decisions
- Regulatory announcements

## Data Processing Architecture

### Parser Implementation

Using OpenAI's API (or similar LLMs) for structured output:
```python
# Example parser configuration
parser_prompt = {
    "system": "Classify relevance of news to betting market",
    "output_format": "json",
    "classification_scale": [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

### Classification System

Standardized relevance mapping:
- `-1`: Irrelevant
- `0`: Unclear
- `1`: No (negative signal)
- `2`: Unlikely
- `3`: Likely
- `4`: Yes (strong positive signal)

### Multi-Parser Strategy

Deploy multiple parsers for:
- **Redundancy**: Avoid single points of failure
- **Consensus building**: Aggregate multiple opinions
- **Conflict resolution**: Weighted voting or confidence scoring

## Information Flow Management

### Calibration Period

It's **critical** to implement an initial calibration period (e.g., 3 minutes) to:
- Avoid false positives at system startup
- Establish a baseline of existing content
- Prevent interpretation of old content as "new"

### Context Resolution

Each identified article must go through:
1. **Complete content download**
2. **Structured text parsing**
3. **Context resolution**: Determining relevance for target markets
4. **Trading decision**: Evaluating whether information justifies action

The system must operate in a continuous loop, constantly polling URLs to identify new content.

## Event Handler System

### Event Processing Flow

1. **Data collection** from monitored sources
2. **Parser routing** for content analysis
3. **Response aggregation** from multiple parsers
4. **Trading decision** based on classification
5. **Order submission** to exchanges

### Confidence Mapping

Map parser outputs to trading actions:
```python
confidence_map = {
    "yes": {"action": "buy", "max_price": 0.90},
    "likely": {"action": "buy", "max_price": 0.80},
    "maybe": {"action": "buy", "max_price": 0.75},
    "unlikely": {"action": "sell", "max_price": 0.30},
    "no": {"action": "sell", "max_price": 0.10}
}
```

### Trading Decision Logic

Pre-trade checks:
- Existing position verification
- Information relevance assessment
- Multi-outcome conflict detection
- Capital and risk limit validation

## Order Management

### Position Checking

Before placing new orders:
1. Query current positions
2. Check if position already obtained in previous cycle
3. Calculate available capital
4. Assess risk exposure

### Price Capping Strategy

Dynamic price limits based on:
- Parser confidence level (YES: 90 cents, MAYBE: 75 cents, etc.)
- Market volatility
- Position size
- Available liquidity

### Local Order Book Management

Maintain local order book copy to:
- Calculate market impact
- Determine optimal order size
- Avoid excessive price movement (€500 orders can move prices by 20-30 cents)
- Minimize slippage
- Ensure price format compliance with exchange requirements

## Execution Considerations

### Order Routing

Order execution requires:
- Ultra-low latency connections
- Real-time risk management
- Position monitoring
- Predefined exit strategies
- Compliance with exchange-specific pricing formats

### Exchange Integration

Critical considerations:
- Exchange-specific order formats
- Price tick requirements
- API rate limits
- Order rejection handling
- Fill confirmation processing

## Risk Management

### Liquidity Considerations

- Monitor cumulative order book depth
- Cap order size to available liquidity at target price
- Implement graduated order placement
- Track market impact metrics
- Be aware that markets are very illiquid

### Multi-Outcome Contract Handling

Special logic for mutually exclusive outcomes:
```python
# Example: "Which coin will Robinhood list next?"
# Options: VIRTU, FARTCOIN, SOL, etc.
if contract_type == "multi_outcome":
    # If VIRTU is selected, all others go to 0
    check_conflicting_positions()
    prevent_redundant_orders()
```

## System Integration

### Component Architecture

```
Information Sources → Scrapers → Parsers → Event Handler → Order Manager → Exchange API
                         ↑                      ↓
                         └── Logger & Monitor ←─┘
```

### Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive logging for:
- Scraper failures and site changes
- Parser response times and accuracy
- Order execution and fills
- System performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting

## Best Practices and Recommendations

1. **Source diversification**: Don't depend on a single information source
2. **System redundancy**: Implement backups for critical components
3. **Continuous monitoring**: Real-time dashboards for performance and errors
4. **Risk management**: Predefined limits for exposure and losses
5. **Compliance**: Ensure all activities are legal and compliant
6. **Scalability**: Design to handle increasing data volumes
7. **Continuous testing**: Backtesting and paper trading before deployment
8. **Documentation**: Maintain updated documentation of all components
9. **Parser optimization**: Multiple parsers for redundancy and accuracy
10. **Market impact awareness**: Understand liquidity constraints of each market
